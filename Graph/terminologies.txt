1. Vertices: Vertices are the nodes of the graph.
2. Edge: The lines that connect the vertices together.
3. Unweighted graph: A graph which doesn't have a weight associated with any edge.
4. Weighted graph: A graph which has a weight associated with all edges.
5. Undirected Graph: In case the edges of the graph do not have a direction associated with them.
6. Directed Graph: In case the edges of the graph do have a direction associated to each of them.
7. Cyclic Graph: If there is even one loop in the graph, it is called Cyclic Graph.
8. Acyclic Graph: If there is no loop in the graph.
9. Tree: A special case of directed acyclic graph.

Graph types:-
1. Directed: Weighted(positive and negative) and Unweighted.
2. Undirected: Weighted(positive and negative) and Unweighted.

A. Unweighted-Undirected Graph: No weights on edges and No direction between vertices.
B. Unweighted-Directed Graph: No weights on edges but direction is available between vertices.
C. Positive-Weighted-Undirected Graph: Positive Weights on the edges but no direction is available between vertices.
D. Positive-Weighted-Directed Graphs: Positive Weights on the edges and direction is available between vertices.
E. Negative-Weighted-Undirected Graph: Negative Weights on the edges but no direction is available between vertices.
F. Negative-Weighted-Directed Graphs: Negative Weights on the edges and direction is available between vertices.


Adjacency Matrix: It is a square matrix or a 2D array and the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.
